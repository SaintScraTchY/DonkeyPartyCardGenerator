## üèõÔ∏è About the "Hezb-e Kharan"

The "Donkey Party" was a real, satirical political party in Iran founded in the 1940s. Its 'manifesto' was a humorous critique aimed at keeping politicians humble, reminding them not to become self-important.
It playfully suggested that "donkeys" (representing hardworking, non-malicious beings) embodied a humility and honesty that politicians worldwide would do well to remember. This project is a lighthearted tribute to that historical satire.
